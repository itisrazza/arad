# Home Server Utilities

These are some custom-written utilities made to monitor and manage my home
server (arad).

## Utilities

* bk (Burger King) - Backup scripts
* db (DB Export Gold) - Dashboard
* telecom (Spark) - Notifications (via [Pushover])

They are so creatively named due to the naming strategy I already had in place
for my hard drives.

* Raid (main storage)
* Shadow (on-line backup)
* Legend (some other laptop hard drive I stuck in there, not backed up, thus will become a legend once it fails)

## Future Plans

* osu - Off-site backup (for the shadow drive)
* comrades - Off-site backup (for my friends on this server)

## Rationale

I've put these up on GitHub to have them available if I ever need them, as well
as get feedback on the from the community (if you'd like to do that).

Also feel free to fork and customise for your own server.
